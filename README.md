Programming Principles and Practice using C++ (3rd Edition) by Bjarne Stroustrup

Chapter 3: Computation

This chapter presents the basics of computation. It discusses expression, selection, and iteration. It also talks about how a specific sub-computation 
can be named and separate as a function. The primary goal is to express computations in a way that leads to a correct and well-organized program. It
also introduces the vector type.
